To mitigate the issue, add a pause and resume mechanism to your camera controls. This will prevent the corruption by ensuring the camera isn't switching while actively writing video data.

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

// ... other code ...

const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [cameraType, setCameraType] = useState(Camera.Type.back);
const [recording, setRecording] = useState(null);

const switchCamera = async () => {
  if (isRecording) {
    await recording.pauseAsync();
    setCameraType(
      cameraType === Camera.Type.back ? Camera.Type.front : Camera.Type.back
    );
    await recording.resumeAsync();
  } else {
    setCameraType(
      cameraType === Camera.Type.back ? Camera.Type.front : Camera.Type.back
    );
  }
};

// ... rest of the component ...
```
This revised code pauses recording before switching cameras, reducing the likelihood of video corruption.  A perfect solution requires a proper fix in the Expo Camera API.
